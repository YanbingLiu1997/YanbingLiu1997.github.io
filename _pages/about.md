I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I am supervised by Prof. [Chunyi Peng](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/chunyi/).

Before I joined CS@Purdue, I received my master and bachelor degrees from the [Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science](https://eeis.ustc.edu.cn/) at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

My current research interests are in the area of mobile networking, with a focus on 5G/6G networks measurement and design.
